The document appears to be a list of test cases or scenarios that need to be implemented.\n\nThe third and fourth documents, both titled \"User-Stories.md\", provide information on how to write user stories in the context of software development. They outline five key elements: title/name, description, acceptance criteria and tests, attachments, and implementation notes. The documents seem to be providing guidance on how to structure and implement user stories in a way that is clear, concise, and comprehensive."
